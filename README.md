# Lorekeeper's Ledger

This is a small project that utilizes `Scrapy`` in a single file,`main.py``, to scrape data for testing another project I'm developing for a client. I thought it might be interesting to share the concept of using `Scrapy` in a single file, so I decided to publish it.

To run the project you just need to clone this repository and run:

```bash
cd lorekeepers-ledger

# &

python main.py
```
